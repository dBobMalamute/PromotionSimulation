<h1>Modeling Gender Differences in the Job Promotion Process</h1>
<h3>Abstract</h3>
Although observed gender differences in employee performance ratings tend to be negligible in any given rating cycle, even small differences may accumulate over time and lead to practically significant differences in promotion outcomes.  A highly cited demonstration of how this cumulative advantage process might work is found in Martell et al. (1996), which simulates small differences in periodic performance ratings within a multi-level organization, resulting in long-term disadvantages in promotions for women.  We replicated this simulation and uncover important details about its operating assumptions, and we also expanded the simulation to examine a range of variables that may impact how gender bias affects promotion.  The extended simulation reveals that the results presented in Martell et al. would require: (a) decades of typical promotion cycles in organizations to produce, (b) a constant amount of bias in performance ratings, and individual ratings that never change during an employeeâ€™s tenure, (c) random attrition at fairly low and constant rate, and (d) equal variances in the distribution of performance ratings for female and male employees.  Our extended simulation shows that, by varying just a few of these factors, very different levels of gender stratification will be observed.  Most notably, female representation within a firm was more affected by the attrition level and amount of variance in performance ratings than the assumed average level of gender bias in those ratings. These results suggest that designing and implementing organization-wide structural changes that emphasize talent development and recognition is more likely to have a greater impact on the promotion of women than interventions aimed at reducing gender bias.
